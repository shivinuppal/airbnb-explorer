I'm less concerned with fancy places to stay as I will spend most of my travel time exploring the destination until I come home to rest.

'm a planner, very organized, responsible and detail oriented.As a host: plan on opening up a room in my home to rent out starting January. I have lived in Seattle nearly my entire life and know all the ins and outs of this city. My boyfriend Moe and I live in this 3 bedroom home with our dog and cat.

My wife and I operate a new tourist rental company called Lake Sammamish Rentals and we do all of the residential bookings through AirBnB.  We are new to AirBnB but we’re not new to the rental business.  In fact, we’ve been doing it longer than AirBnB.  If you ever rented a private RV in San Diego you probably rented it from us, or at least ran across our business.  In fact, if you go to YouTube and search for “ComeGetMyRV Fox 5 News” you can see the news segment as well as other customer testimonials about the quality of rental service we’ve been providing since 2006.  But before you ask, and start planning an RV road trip to San Diego we sold the RV business, moved to WA, used our prior experience from that business and now have rental properties in Seattle and Sammamish. The Sammamish lake view property is located on the East Side, an area that is known for being more of a suburban family area, and the Seattle property is on the West Side in a suburb next to downtown Seattle, which is known for its artsy laid back and eclectic vibe.  While that was a lot of what may have been useless information to some, it was a long way of telling you that even though we don’t have a lot of reviews on AirBnB, we are trustworthy, experienced and work to provide customer satisfaction so that you’ll have the best stay possible.

Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within an HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. Holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. You can book as far as 13 months out.*If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.If you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)I have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.Almost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.Sadly, the resorts do not allow pets.Wifi is $4.95/day or $15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.This is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. They'll even give you a present if you say yes! Saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. BE SMART - SAY NO - GO ENJOY YOUR VACATION! :)We've had too many bad experiences with guests from Orange County, California. If you are a current or former resident of Orange County and would like to rent from us, kindly be kind in your messages; we'll get the hint that you're a decent person and will welcome you with open arms.***Feel good about your vacation!

(pictured here)Friends who know me know that I love being a steward to houses, even working by day for a house moving company where we save full-sized Craftsman-style homes by physically *moving* them from one place to another (by land or by barge). Nickel Bros house moves have been featured on Home & Garden TV's shows Haulin' House, and on Discovery and National Geographic Channels' Monster Moves.My goal is to make your stay at the Architect's Gem one of the best you've ever had!— JeffAbout Owners: Brandon & ShannaA family of Architects (plus two kids), we are live a bi-coastal existence. We started our architecture firm about 13 years ago, and we've enjoyed fantastic growth, designing Green homes and Live/Work urban condominiums and apartment units throughout the Seattle area. We are proud to have contributed to the built-space of Seattle in a positive, forward-thinking way, and one of the first places we started was renovating our own home — which you can now enjoy.Why West Seattle:We *love* our West Seattle home, and because we are architects we've been able to add to the home's charm over the years as we've lived in it. The house itself is a classic 1917 Bungalow, but we've added some great usable space and functionality, with an open kitchen design and warm and inviting touches architectural details. We were drawn to West Seattle because of the wonderful, varied and diverse individual urban neighborhoods that West Seattle has to offer: Admiral District (where we are); Alki Beach (must-see); Alaska Junction (the main urban core); Morgan Junction (great pub and restaurants); Fauntleroy/Endolyne (Ferry to Vashon and Peninsula, great restaurants); Westwood Village (convenient 'town centre' mall). We think you will really enjoy this comfortable and inviting house!The Unique Benefits at this House:ur home is one that you will immediately feel 'at home' with. We've designed the flow to give you both open and public spaces, as well as private nooks and quiet places to rest and relax. Fall deeply into the comfortable master bed and open up your book, or enjoy entertaining with friends or family during your stay in the large open kitchen and family room. Walk a few short blocks to the nearby pubs, bars, and restaurants, enjoy a jaunt down to Alki Beach for a nice Mexican meal at Cactus! and take a walk along the boardwalk after your dessert. During the day you can rent bikes or rollerblades and ride along the longest boardwalk (walking and biking path) in Seattle. Visit Salty's restaurant on Harbor Avenue overlooking the Seattle skyline, or even rent scuba gear and scuba dive with the local in the Elliott Bay. Or, if you want to tour the Pike Place Market by day or enjoy the Seattle nightlife downtown, hop in your car and in 13 minutes (during light traffic) you will be downtown!

I lived on Capitol Hill in a condo until moving to this house on North Beacon Hill in 2002.  This neighborhood is RELATIVELY close to downtown (but not IN downtown) and convenient for AirBnB guests with vehicle who are looking for a compromise between hostel and motel or else don't mind riding public transit or using UberX and Lyft to visit all the major tourist sights.I spend most of my time reading or on my computer in my office. I am a self-employed property manager who lives/works from home so talking to guests who visit is a refreshing break from a mostly solitary life.  I have a degree in English literature and traveled widely before settling down and getting married to my house.  I am happy to rent extra space in my home out as long as you are a clean, quiet, self-sufficient and low-maintenance guest.  Please note AirBnB does not do criminal background checks so when I get a request I WILL look your name up on the internet to see if you appear to have a safe profile.  Please make sure your booking request includes the information I request for best results. I started hosting people in July 2014.  As a host I need guests to make sure they understand what they are getting. I don't want a guest who doesn't bother to read my listing, then gives me less than 5 stars for things they should've expected before arriving (such as LOCATION - how does a host fix their Location? It's on the map!) or Value (did you not search other listings first? If you want Value join the homeless and go pitch a tent downtown! They have a better location, no house rules, and don't have to recycle!) If you don't understand the cost of owning real estate  in Seattle with its property taxes, sales taxes, cost of utilities and insurance rates, then don't review me on your assumptions of what you think the room price should be here without doing some comparison shopping first. We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!  Bottom line: I offer cheap room rentals for short-stay travelers as long as they are well-behaved guests. If you are looking for hotel quality accommodations at this price on Airbnb - you're just NOT going to find it unless you pay hotel quality prices or stay in a place much further out from downtown.If you are new to AirBnB please look up the internet article:ead These Tips, or Nobody Will Ever Let You Be an Airbnb Guest Again.

There's nothing better than roasted pork tenderloin, perhaps wrapped in bacon with a honey, balsamic vinegar, and red wine sauce. I could eat pork breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'm from California, so I'm not a typical Northwestern person. I like recycling, but composting is the absolute worst. I like saving the world and being green friendly, but I'm also cheap and hate buying more expensive green products. I love to travel and experience new things. I'm always looking for an inexpensive getaway for a week or weekend. (We may have that in common?) I'm also an introvert, which makes me kind of a contradiction since I'm also really loud and possibly obnoxious. My life motto: Don't be an a-hole. And that is the truth. And be extra nice to people in service jobs, k thanks.People tell me I'm funny. It's true. I am funny. Someone told me I'm captivating the other day. That just makes me roll my eyes though.I am a fanboy for Jurassic Park. It's my favorite movie, and I will not tolerate anyone disliking it! You can dislike numbers 2-4 though. I won't fault you that. Maybe just don't bring it up. ;)I'm also a ridiculous fan of Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire. Maybe you'll see my tattoo from the novels. MAYBE NOT.My favorite all time place to travel is South Lake Tahoe. I grew up going there every year, and it just doesn't get any better than that. There is something particularly magnificent about its smell. Pine trees are my favorite. You might notice that in my tree-themed library/entryway. I love trees.Places I've traveled to: Caribbean, France, Spain, Italy, Monaco, Israel, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, Grand Canyon, Chicago, Boston, Vancouver, BC, Portland, OR, Ukraine, Austria, Hungary, Thailand, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and New Zealand.

My dog: have a female dog named Lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. She still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that I don't think I will ever train her out of. Lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. A little more about my background if your curious: am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. I transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching. I'm not currently teaching but am working on the choreography for my next class/bootcamp and hope to teach again soon. I'd love to have my guests join when that time comes.

Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!A little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes.

I call the Northwest home, it is a beautiful place that I am grateful to know. I took my first international trip at 9 years old, to Mexico with my mother and two of my older sisters, it was magical and lit a spark in me for traveling and experiencing new places and people. At 17 I traveled to Brisbane Australia where I lived for two months. They drank. They were chill. At 21 I headed for Capetown South Africa, where I blessed to spend 3 months studying, traveling and building relationships. The people I met  on this trip are still positively influencing me today. At 26 I sold my car and bought a ticket to Xela, Quetzaltenango Guatemala where I spent one month with some of the most warmly-spirited people you could ever hope to meet. I attended Pop-Wuj, a local language school and community restoration group, and the Trama Textile weaving school/non-profit business, where I was surrounded by gorgeous textiles full of the colors and stories of the various villages in the area. If you ever make it to Xela, I would check out the love-work being done in both of these spaces. Traveling the United States became a passion of mine after I road-tripped to Chicago from Seattle with one of my best friends. I was in awe of the land and the skies and felt a renewed sense of this place. I realized that even if I wasn't traveling internationally, I still had opportunities to travel in my home country, and there is just as much to 'know' and see here as anywhere else-AND SO THE ERA OF ROAD TRIPS BEGAN!. My family road tripped up and down the west-coast my entire childhood but the Midwest and South were uncharted territory for me......There are some other secret spaces and places, that are for me and my memories to hold, places and destinations so special only a wrong-turn and open heart could have made it so :)I have made the space I live in a home over the past 6 years and appreciate the evolution.

I made it as comfortable as possible for you, but it is hard to combat age and for lack of a better word,  basementness. If you are short, on a budget, or used to the youth hostel lifestyle, this may be the place for you. I am a professor at the UW, here in Seattle.  In the winter I am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.  When I was eleven years old, I saw Star Wars Episode 4, and I haven't been able to concentrate since then. Even though I am solidly into middle age, I love living in my super hip Seattle neighborhood, and I still go see live music a couple times a month.  In my twenties and thirties, I would backpack through Europe once or twice a year.  One of the greatest things I ever did was decide to rent an apartment in Prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel.  I decided to create this little, private, room in my house so that young travelers ( maybe you?) can visit Seattle on a budget. I have traveled all over the world, maybe I have visited your town? What type of place is this?Are you looking for an expensive, warm, plush, modern room with great light and tall ceilings?  If so, you should probably move on.  This is a tiny, private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement.  Basements have LOW ceilings, about 6 foot 2 inches, with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under.  In the winter, basements tend to be cold and damp, there is no way to avoid this. I will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isn't enough for you.   It has a full size fridge, a coffee pot, a TV, wired and wireless internet, a small bed, a desk, a microwave, a coffee maker, a teapot, a pizza oven.... If you are short, ( ceiling is only 6' tall) if you are a traveler on a budget, if you are used to staying in 2 star European hostels and hotels, and sharing a bath with 20 other people, this place will be perfect for you. Basically, this is a Hobbit hole, if you are looking for someplace super nice, move on.  If you are looking for something affordable in an AMAZING NEIGHBORHOOD this may work for you.  You can walk downtown in 35 mins, 10 mins to Broadway, and 3 mins to grocery stores, bars, and amazing restaurants...What type of host am I?You may never even see me.

We both came to Seattle in 1979; Charlie from Brooklyn by way of NJ and Sarah from Texas by way of the world. We met in 1983 and were married on 8-8-88.Charlie has a background in environmental affairs, non-profit leadership and government service. He is also an accomplished amateur photographer. Sarah has a background in art, is a Real Estate agent and manages our properties. Our interests are art, music, dance, cooking, gardening and caring for our 3 god-children. We bought this house in 2001 and lived in it for 12 years.  We have recently bought a house in the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle to be closer to our god-children - which made this home available for airbnb. We travel often to Mexico, Texas, around the Pacific NW and to the NJ-NY area.  We just celebrated our 25th Anniversary by spending a month in Paris.
