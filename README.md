# airbnb-explorer

Welcome to our Airbnb Explorer app!

To run this application, you need to make sure you have the standard set up done for Node/React apps.

You need to install Oracle locally.

1. cd server
2. npm i oracledb
3. Here is a helpful link if you will be running this on a Mac:
https://vanwollingen.nl/install-oracle-instant-client-and-sqlplus-using-homebrew-a233ce224bf

Our application uses the Google Maps API for which one needs an API key. We
have removed this key. Please add one of your own.

That should set you up! You're ready to run the app.

1. cd server
2. npm start
3. cd client
4. npm start

The app will open in your browser & you're good to go!

If you have any questions, please reach out to the team!
